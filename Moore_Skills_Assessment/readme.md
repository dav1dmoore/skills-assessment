The skills assessent employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render a general contacts page. The only place my solution does not match the image is the size of the column one in the selected table row. The size of the table data elements expand to the largest child within the parent table row. If I was going to do this project over I would consider employing divs, using grid to place them side by side, instead of a table markup to ensure an exact replica. Furthermore for ease of coding, I would employ jquery for easy, smooth transitioning. 

All other functionality is present.

This is the final submission. I utilized Steve's input to address the positioning on the elements to mirror the exact functionality requested. Furthermore, I added a small piece of javascript to adjust the style attribute on the bottom contacts so that the their information displays in the opposite direction, as the absolute positioning would have otherwise had the information content box escaping the body and covering the footer. Thank you for the chance to make improvements!
